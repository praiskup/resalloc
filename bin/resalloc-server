    pretty short critical section when no other thread can set() the event.
    This way, it is guaranteed that no set() call will be missed by manager
    between explicit wait() and clear().

    We could actually use plain threading.Condition instead, but to not loose
    any of the notify() actions, the whole time-period of manager's loop would
