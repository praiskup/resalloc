# useless-object-inheritance
#     We support python 2.
# import-error
#     This is to work-around the issues in our diff-lint CI where we do not have
#     all the build/runtime requirements installed.  We can ignore this error
#     because the packaging CI would actually discover the import issues anyway.
# too-few-public-methos
#     Deliberately using classes instead of namedtuple, because it helps us with
#     typing (completion).
# consider-using-f-string
#     We still support EPEL7.
# too-many-lines
# too-many-locals
# too-many-branches
#     Stylis errors that are low-priority, and sometimes hard to avoid.
